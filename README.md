<h1>Hashy</h1>
<b>Hashy</b> is a simple hashing utlity created by AstroOrbis with help from opensource countributors.
Our project can hash into MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512. Hashing is often used to verify the integrity of a file after it
has been transferred from one place to another, typically in a file backup program. To ensure the transferred
file is not corrupted, a user can compare the hash value of both files. If they are the same, then the transferred file is
an identical copy.

Hashing can be very useful to devlopers (especially if you are storing your code locally on your computer), and <b>Hashy</b>
can do it for you!
